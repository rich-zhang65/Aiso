Convert your boring orthographic drawings into a 3D object using SolidWorks.

Instructions:
1. Clone repository.
2. Use Flask to run webpage on localhost.
3. Draw orthographic views, and hit submit to send that information to Python/Flask.
4. Run create3d.py with SolidWorks also open.
5. Watch as your object comes to life!


The original idea of rendering the object on the web did not seem possible, so SolidWorks must be downloaded.
Current version does not support full conversion of drawing -> model.
This is currently a proof-of-concept project.
